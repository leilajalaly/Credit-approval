# Credit-approval
Evaluate graph convolution neural networks on credit dateset + Some traditional machine learning algorithms
This research evaluate the idea of graph convolutional neural network to predict credit approval of an applicant. The two graph-based models are GCN ( graph convolutional neural network) and GraphSAGE( SAmple and aggreGatE).
These two models are new approache for node classification task. The test carried out based on supervised learning but only 30% are training data and the rest are testing
The outcome is very compatable with machine learning thechniques like KNN, Random Forest and Autoencoder(tested semi-supervised)
